                <h3>Project Title: Loan Prediction App
                </h3>
                <p>The Loan Prediction App is designed to help financial institutions assess loan eligibility quickly and accurately. By inputting key details such as loan amount, tenure, interest rate, and applicant information (e.g., income, credit score, employment status), the app utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict whether an applicant qualifies for a loan. The app provides an instant evaluation, streamlining the decision-making process for lenders while offering users immediate feedback on their loan eligibility.</p>
                <p>Tools and libraries used: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Seaborn, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Mlflow, Jupyter Notebook</p>

                <h3>Project Title: Ola Driver Churn Prediction App</h3>
                <p>The Ola Driver Churn Prediction App is designed to help Ola identify drivers at risk of leaving the platform. By analyzing inputs such as age, gender, education, income, quarterly ratings, and other driver-related data, the app uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a driver discontinuing their partnership with Ola. This tool can enable Ola to take proactive measures to improve driver retention and satisfaction by addressing potential issues before they lead to churn.</p>

                <h3>Project Title: Text Summarization</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on implementing a fine-tuned text summarization model based on the Pegasus Samsum dataset from Hugging Face Transformers. The model is optimized to generate concise, accurate summaries of conversations, making it ideal for applications like summarizing customer support dialogues, meetings, or any other form of textual conversations. The model is deployed using FastAPI, providing a fast, scalable web service that can process and summarize conversations in real-time, offering a user-friendly interface for integration into various platforms. This solution aims to enhance productivity by reducing the time needed to review lengthy conversation transcripts.</p>
                <p>Tools and libraries used: Python, Transformers, datasets, nltk, FastAPI </p>

                <h3>Project Title: News Categorization System</h3>
                <p>The News Categorization System is designed to automatically classify news articles into predefined categories such as Sports, Business, Technology, Politics, and more. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes the content of news articles and assigns them to the appropriate category with high accuracy. This tool helps streamline the news distribution process, making it easier for readers to access content relevant to their interests while enabling media platforms to organize and manage their content more.</p>

                <h3>Project Title: Vegetable Image Classification System</h3>
                <p>The Vegetable Image Classification System uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning techniques to classify images of vegetables into categories such as Potato, Tomato, Onion, and more. By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on a vegetable dataset, the system can accurately identify and categorize various vegetable images. The model is deployed using Streamlit, offering an interactive and user-friendly interface where users can upload images and receive real-time classification results. This solution is ideal for applications in agriculture, food industry, and inventory management.</p>

                <h3>Project Title: Vegetable Image Classification System</h3>
                <p>he University Admission Prediction System is a regression-based model designed to predict the likelihood (in percentage) of a student being admitted to a foreign university. The model takes into account key factors such as TOEFL score, GRE score, CGPA, Letter of Recommendation (LOR), and whether the student has published any research papers. Using these parameters, the model provides a predictive score indicating the chances of admission, helping prospective students assess their application strength and make informed decisions. This system aims to assist students in understanding their admission prospects and preparing accordingly.</p>
